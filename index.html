  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Alfredo's background was in IT and Telecomms having worked for one of the early silicon valley start-ups named <strong>International Network Services (INS)</strong> as one of their Senior Network Engineers specialising in <em><a
        href="https://cisco.com">Cisco Networks</a></em>.
    He went on to start up a networking consultancy along with providing angel funds to new companies in various industries. This led him to work with a small company called <strong>Silidrone Markets Ltd</strong> who were trying to enter the arena of
    algorthmic trading of Financial instruments. </p>
  <p>Having parted ways with them in 2018 he decided to begin his own Algorithmic trading company in 2022 but quickly found that getting people to do the things he wanted the way he wanted was proving to be difficult. As a result he was determined to try and do things himself but thought better of it. He decided to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, JAVA, Angular, SQL, React, AWS, NodeJS, Python, MultiThreading, Linux, SpringBoot. </p>
